                Hello! I'm Jack, a recent computer science graduate and aspiring
                software engineer from the University of Colorado, Boulder. Ever
                since my first exposure to programming in middle school, I've
                been captivated by the limitless potential of what one can
                create with a computer. From immersive games and dynamic
                websites to sophisticated artificially-intelligent agents, I
                believe coding has the distinct power to breathe life into
                ideas. This belief fuels my love for software development and is
                at the heart of everything I create.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p class="about-wrapper__info-text">
                In the realm of software engineering, the unique blend of
                leadership, communication, and teamwork skills I've honed over
                the years complement my technical proficiency. Serving as both a
                lacrosse team captain and officer at CU Boulder, and as the
                communications lead for my senior capstone project with Northrop
                Grumman, I have learned to balance strategy, execution, and
                adaptability in high-pressure situations. These experiences have
                shaped me, not just as a developer, but also as a leader.
              </p>

              <p class="about-wrapper__info-text">
                Outside the world of software development, I find balance and
                inspiration in a blend of outdoor activities and intellectual
                pursuits. Whether it's hiking along scenic trails, pushing my
                limits in the weightroom, or cheering on my favorite football,
                hockey, and basketball teams, I'm driven by a love for staying
                active. I'm also a book enthusiast, often diving into varied
                topics such as business, philosophy, self-development, and
                history. These diverse interests provide me with a well-rounded
                personality and a fresh perspective in my work. I'm an explorer,
                a lifelong learner, and above all, a team player ready to
                contribute to an amazing team.

                  <p class="mb-4">
                    This capstone project focused on the creation of custom
                    prediction models for autonomous driving, done in
                    collaboration with <b>Northrop Grumman</b>. I led the development
                    of a polished and user-friendly web app that hosted and
                    demonstrated our team's prediction models. The application,
                    developed using <b>HTML, CSS, Sass, and JavaScript</b>, served as an
                    interactive interface that significantly impressed our
                    client, Northrop Grumman.
                  </p>
                  <p class="mb-4">
                    Furthermore, I assumed the responsibility of the
                    <b>communications lead</b>, ensuring smooth collaboration and
                    timely project delivery by facilitating effective
                    communication between my team and Northrop Grumman.
                  </p>
                  <p class="mb-4">
                    One of the primary technical achievements of this project
                    was the design and implementation of highly accurate and
                    robust prediction models using <b>Python, PyTorch, and L5Kit</b>.
                    The precision and performance of these models not only met
                    but surpassed the client's requirements, earning high praise
                    for their technical performance.

                  Reinforcement Learning - Gridworld, Crawler, Pac-Man

                  <p class="mb-4">
                    The main focus of this project was to implement <b>value iteration and 
                      Q-learning</b>, two crucial concepts in reinforcement learning. The 
                      algorithms were initially tested on <b>Gridworld</b>, a standard 
                      test environment used in reinforcement learning, to ascertain their correctness.
                  </p>
                  <p class="mb-4">
                    The project then expanded to apply these algorithms to a simulated robot 
                    controller, referred to as <b>Crawler</b>, and the classic arcade game, 
                    <b>Pac-Man</b>. Both these applications offered a more complex and 
                    realistic environment, testing the robustness and flexibility of the 
                    implemented algorithms.
                  </p>
                  <p class="mb-4">
                    A significant part of the project was dedicated to coding the value 
                      iteration and Q-learning agents for Gridworld, Crawler, 
                      and Pac-Man in <b>Python</b>. The code was tested for technical correctness using an autograder, 
                      which ensured that the algorithms behaved as expected in various scenarios.
                  </p>
                  <p class="mb-4">
                    The project also involved analyzing and answering specific questions related to 
                    the behavior of the agents and the learning process. This aspect was crucial in 
                    understanding the theoretical underpinnings of the implemented algorithms.
                  </p>
                  <p class="mb-4">
                    This project reinforced my abilities in reinforcement learning, particularly in 
                    implementing and understanding the intricacies of value iteration and Q-learning. 
                    It also displayed my capacity to apply these techniques to solve complex problems in 
                    various scenarios, ranging from grid environments to game domains and robotic controls.

                <div>
                  <p class="mb-4">
                    The main objective of this project was to implement <b>"curve fitting"</b> 
                    or regression for given data using <b>genetic algorithms</b> (evolutionary search). 
                    The project was conducted by running various benchmark examples to study its 
                    performance.
                  </p>
                  <p class="mb-4">
                    The crux of the project was the <b>regression problem</b>, a fundamental problem 
                    in machine learning, where the task was to find a function  𝑦 = 𝑓(𝑥) that passes 
                    through some given data points. Given the challenge of overfitting in machine 
                    learning, the aim was to find a function that minimized the loss function or 
                    provided a least square fit.
                  </p>
                  <p class="mb-4">
                    One of the main challenges faced was the unknown form of the function  𝑓, 
                    thus requiring a search for  𝑓 from a family of functions {𝑓1, …, 𝑓𝑁}. This 
                    aspect introduced the complexity of dealing with a potentially infinite set of functions.
                  </p>
                  <p class="mb-4">
                    An important component of the project was generating arbitrary expressions 
                    at random, done using the <b>generate_random_expr</b> function in the 
                    makeRandomExpressions.py file. This function was crucial for creating diverse and 
                    random expressions for the genetic algorithm to work upon.
                  </p>
                  <p class="mb-4">
                    Additionally, a <b>viability check</b> for each expression was also implemented 
                    to eliminate any non-viable or ill-defined expressions. This was achieved using 
                    the function is_viable_expr() in the file fitnessAndValidityFunctions.py.
                  </p>
                  <p class="mb-4">
                    A key aspect of this project was the use of a <b>fitness function</b> to calculate 
                    the negation of the least square error, with the goal of maximizing it. This function, 
                    compute_fitness(), was crucial in framing the genetic algorithm in terms of fitness 
                    maximization.
                  </p>
                  <p class="mb-4">
                    Lastly, the project required the implementation of two essential operators for 
                    genetic algorithms: <b>crossover</b> and <b>mutation</b>. These operators, 
                    random_subtree_crossover() and random_expression_mutation(), respectively, 
                    allowed the algorithm to generate diverse solutions and traverse the search space 
                    effectively.
